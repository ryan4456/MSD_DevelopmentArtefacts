# MSD_DevelopmentArtefacts
This is the development artefacts of the second assignment of Mobile System Development.
## 01_01_Refined Design Document.pdf
The design document is redefined according to the the comments from Assignment 1. Ther are mainly two places modified.

1. The Scope section is too wide in the previous version. I narrowed it down to make it more specific and achievable. 
2. The evaluation criteria are not enough, so I added three more test cases to evaluate the application, and the application will become more robust.
